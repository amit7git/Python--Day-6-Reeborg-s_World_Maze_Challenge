# Day 6 – Reeborg's World Maze Challenge 🤖🧩

Part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** challenge.  
This project solves the Reeborg’s World Maze Challenge using Python logic and problem-solving techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Reeborg's World Maze Challenge features a robot (Reeborg) placed at a random location in a maze, facing a random direction.  
The goal is to guide Reeborg safely to the finish line using logical instructions and conditional movement.

This challenge focuses on writing adaptable logic that works regardless of the robot’s starting position.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Writing reusable code using functions
- Using `while` loops to repeat actions until a condition is met
- Structuring logic for readability and efficiency
- Solving dynamic problems where conditions change
- Strengthening problem-solving skills using Python

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. Reeborg starts at a random position in the maze  
2. The program continuously checks for walls and paths  
3. Reeborg moves forward, turns, or adjusts direction based on obstacles  
4. The loop continues until Reeborg reaches the goal  

---

## 💡 Code Highlights
- Use of functions to organize movement logic
- A single solution that works for multiple maze variations
- Logic that successfully solves **Hurdle 3**, **Hurdle 4**, and **Maze** challenges
- Efficient use of condition checking and loops

---

## 🧪 Example
Reeborg starts at a random position.
Checks for walls.
Turns when blocked.
Moves forward when possible.
Repeats until the goal is reached.
